# Blue-Print-Game-with-open-cv-using-python3
This repository contains a computer vision project implemented in Python 3 using OpenCV. The project focuses on performing various image manipulations and incorporates a hidden tracker to track user interactions on any image. By leveraging the power of OpenCV, users can click on specific points within an image to initiate manipulations in the designated area. The project offers an interactive interface for exploring computer vision techniques and observing real-time changes in processed images. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in image processing, computer vision, or OpenCV experimentation.
